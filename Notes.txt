      - Explain Sensory Processing: Discuss how it involves the way the nervous system receives messages from the senses and turns them into meaningful information.
      - Describe how hyper- or hypo-sensitivity in certain areas can lead to sensory overload, anxiety, or withdrawal.

      - Introduce Repetitive Behaviors: Explain that these are often seen in individuals with ASD and can include lining things up, flapping hands, or repeating words or phrases.
      - Discuss the potential functions of these behaviors (e.g., self-regulation, comfort, or routine-maintaining).

      - Describe Structured Environment: Mention that consistent routines, clear expectations, and predictable transitions can help reduce anxiety and promote learning for neurodiverse students.

   Page 6:
      - Explain the Importance of Individualized Instruction: Highlight how each student with ASD may require unique strategies to support their learning.

   Page 7:
      - Discuss Positive Behavior Support: Mention that understanding the function of behavior can help in developing effective interventions to encourage appropriate behavior.

      - Discuss Accommodations in the Classroom: Mention that accommodations like visual schedules, fidget tools, and quiet spaces can support learning for neurodiverse students.

   Page 12-13:
      - Introduce Assistive Technology: Explain how technology like speech-to-text software, visual aids, or communication devices can help neurodiverse learners communicate more effectively.

   Page 14-15:
      - Discuss Collaboration with Parents and Caregivers: Emphasize the importance of working together to support the child's needs both at school and at home.

      - Provide resources for further reading and support, including websites, books, and organizations dedicated to helping neurodiverse learners.

   Conclusion:
      - Emphasize the importance of understanding and embracing neurodiversity in our classrooms.
      - Encourage a supportive, inclusive learning environment for all students, regardless of their abilities or challenges.
